                interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc. If the "Enable in init. code" is set to "yes" value 
                then the device is also enabled(see the description of the Enable() method). In this case the Enable() method 
                is not necessary and needn't to be generated.
   - UART_Deinit -Deinitializes the device. Switches off the device, frees the device data structure memory, interrupts vectors,
                etc.
   - UART_SendBlock -Sends a block of characters. The method returns ERR_BUSY when the previous block transmission is not 
                completed. Method <CancelBlockTransmission> can be used to cancel a transmit operation. This method is 
                available only if the transmitter property is enabled.
   - UART_ReceiveBlock -Specifies the number of data to receive. The method returns ERR_BUSY until the specified number of 
                characters is received. Method <CancelBlockReception> can be used to cancel a running receive operation.
   - UART_GetSentDataNum -Returns the number of sent characters.
   - UART_GetReceivedDataNum -Returns the number of received characters in the receive buffer.
   - UART_GetTxCompleteStatus -Returns whether the transmitter has transmitted all characters and there are no other characters 
                in the transmitter's HW FIFO or the shift register. This method is available only if a peripheral supports this 
                feature.
   - UART_Main -This method is available only in the polling mode (Interrupt service/event = 'no'). If interrupt service is 
                disabled this method replaces the interrupt handler. This method should be called if Receive/SendBlock was 
                invoked before in order to run the reception/transmission. The end of the receiving/transmitting is indicated 
                by OnBlockSent or OnBlockReceived event.

Module "MTIM0"     (component TimerUnit_LDD)
   - MTIM0_Init -Initializes the device. Allocates memory for the device data structure, allocates interrupt vectors and sets 
                interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc. If the property <"Enable in init. code"> is set to 
                "yes" value then the device is also enabled (see the description of the <Enable> method). In this case the 
                <Enable> method is not necessary and needn't to be generated. This method can be called only once. Before the 
                second call of Init the <Deinit> must be called first.
   - MTIM0_Deinit -Deinitializes the device. Switches off the device, frees the device data structure memory, interrupts 
                vectors, etc.
   - MTIM0_Enable -Enables the component - it starts the signal generation. Events may be generated (see SetEventMask). The 
                method is not available if the counter can't be disabled/enabled by HW.
   - MTIM0_Disable -Disables the component - it stops signal generation and events calling. The method is not available if the 
                counter can't be disabled/enabled by HW.
   - MTIM0_GetDriverState -This method returns the current driver status.
